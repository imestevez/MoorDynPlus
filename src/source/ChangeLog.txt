                           MoorDyn C Change Log
==========================================================================

Listing changes since version v1.0.1C
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
               MoorDyn v1.00.02C - Dec. 8, 2015 - Matt Hall
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - fixes in connection force output channels:
   - removed double counting of connection self-weight in net force output
   - added functionality for outputting individual X,Y,Z force components 
     (previously gave 0)
 
 - fixed LinesClose() so that MoorDyn can be called repeatedly without 
   errors (when connect nodes are used)

 - made bottom contact general so that fairlead and anchor ends experiencing 
   bottom contact will not cause problems

 - added NaN check for node positions during simulation and also during 
   initialization

 - integrated contributions from Yi-Hsiang Yu (NREL) and Daniel Combest 
   (ENGYS) for compiling on Mac OSX and Linux, respectively.
   - compiles for OSX with "OSX" defined, compiles for Linux with "LINUX" defined
   - openGL functions are now omitted unless "USEGL" is defined
 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
               MoorDyn v1.00.03C - Jan. 11, 2016 - Matt Hall
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - made various improvements to parsing of input file
   - added recognition of additional keywords as used in the MoorDyn F input files
   - added more informative error messages
   - removed case sensivity in "vessel/fix/connect" keywords
   
 - FIXED ERROR IN NET FORCES!
   - Roll and Yaw moments returned by MoorDyn (the 4th and 6th elements of Flines)
     were completely wrong due to a misuse of the "-=" operator.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------
               MoorDyn v1.00.04C - Feb. 15, 2016 - Matt Hall
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - added units header line to line-specific output files
 - added option "WriteUnits" that, when set to zero, will disable units lines in 
   output files



--------------------------------------------------------------------------
               MoorDyn v1.01.00C - April 20, 2016 - Matt Hall
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - Restructured time stepping interface function to do 3-DOF coupling at individual 
   fairleads rather than 6-DOF coupling at platform reference point.
     - LinesCalc functionality is unchanged - it still provides coupling at platform.
     - New function FairleadsCalc provides coupling at individual fairleads as 
       alternative.  This function replaces the 6-DOF vectors of x, xd, and f (returned) 
       with two-dimensional arrays of x, xd, and f (returned) of size nFairs by 3.
 - Added optional paramter "dtOut" to specify the desired frequency of output file writing
   in seconds.  A zero value (default) gives original behaviour of writing at every call.
 - Callable output function now has a second parameter for coupling step size, dtC.  
    (leave as 0 for original behaviour)
 - Added function to programmatically access any node's position rather than relying on
   output files:  GetNodePos(int LineNum, int NodeNum, double pos[3])
 - Incorporated adjustment to avoid isnan issues on Linux compiles (from Yi-Hsiang Yu, NREL)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
               MoorDyn v1.01.01C - November 5, 2017 - Matt Hall
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - Fixed calculation for outputting tensions at arbitrary nodes along line length in main 
   output file (previously gave zero).  No effect on individual line output files.
 - Added a basic friction model for seabed contact based on a saturated damping approach 
   (described in EWTEC 2017 paper).
 - Corrected fairlead force to include weight of adjacent half-segment (code typo noticed
   by Kellen Devries).
 - Added second fairlead-centric coupling function, FairleadsCalc2, which works with 1D 
   rather than 2D arrays.
 - Corrected anchor tension output (e.g. "AnchTen1") - previously outputted fairlead value.
 - Removed some unused wave kinematics code in preparation for new implementation.
